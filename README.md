Yet Another Snake Clone 

## Description
This is a terminal based game. Is was done with the purpose of experimenting with the Windows Console API. As a bonus I was able to use it as the Final for project for the `Advance Programming Class`

The game have the basic feature of the Snake game. The Snake move in a direction if it collide with the edges is teleported to the opposite site. The Snake have to eat the apples that randomly spawn in the level to get score and a new tail is added. You loose the game by eating one of your tail.
